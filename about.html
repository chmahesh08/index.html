    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the 
        foundational building block of the web.
        It is a standard markup language used to
        create and structure content on websites.
        Every web page you see on the internet—whether
        it contains text, images, videos, or links—relies
        on HTML to define its basic layout and organization. 
        Rather than being a programming language,
        HTML is a descriptive language that tells the 
        browser how content should be displayed.</p>

        One of the key strengths of HTML is its simplicity and accessibility. 
        Beginners can quickly learn the basics and start creating web pages 
        with minimal effort. At the same time, HTML is powerful enough to 
        support complex websites when used alongside other technologies. 
        It works seamlessly with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling 
        and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior. 
        Together, these technologies form the core of modern web development.

        HTML also plays an important role in web accessibility and search engine optimization. 
        Proper use of semantic elements helps screen readers interpret content for visually 
        impaired users and allows search engines to better understand page structure. As the 
        web continues to evolve, HTML remains essential, providing a stable and standardized 
        way to share information globally.
